## Installation

To get started with SOPA, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dmytro-mz/SOPA_hackwarsaw.git
    cd SOPA_hackwarsaw
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can run the SOPA scraper by executing the following command:

```sh
python3 SOPA_scraper.py
```

This will initiate the scraping process, gathering data from various online sources.

## Output

The scraped data is stored in a JSON file named `scraped_data.json` by default. This file contains the collected information about the issues people are facing and their suggestions for improvements.

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to enhance SOPA with the following features:

- **Database Integration**: Store the scraped data in a dedicated database for better scalability and accessibility.
- **Advanced Scraping Techniques**: Improve the scraping logic to handle a wider variety of websites and data formats.
- **Data Analysis**: Implement analytical tools to provide insights and trends based on the scraped data.
- **User Interface**: Develop a web-based interface for users to view and interact with the collected data.
- **Data Access API**: Create an API to allow external applications to access the scraped data easily.
